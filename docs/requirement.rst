Taoda's library contains about 15GB over 17K files.
Therefore, Taoda wants a digital tool to manage his library:

#.  It is cloud-backed.
    Then Taoda will never fear the loss of his collections.
#.  Taoda is sometimes required to work without network connection.
    So, it is required to deploy an offline copy easily.
#.  It can be adhoc queried and quickly answered.
#.  After all, it must be cheap.
